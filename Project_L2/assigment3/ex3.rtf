\f0\fs24 \cf0 Design an app using the AI which contains GUI which allows the user select a FASTA file. The content of the file should be analyzed by using a sliding window for 30 positions. The content of each sliding window should be used in order to extract the relative frequency of the symbols found in the alphabet of the seq. Thus your input should be the DNA seq from the FASTA file, and the output should be the values of relative frequency of each symbols in the alphabet of the seq. Translate in lines on a chart, thus your chart in the case of DNA should have 4 lines which reflect the values found over the sequence}
